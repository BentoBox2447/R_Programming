## Introduction
It's been about a year since I last used R professionally, so I'm doing some basic review to prepare for ISYE 6501 that begins Fall 2022.

## ISYE 6501
### Introduction to Analytics Modeling (ISYE 6501) Description:
This course gives a basic introduction to a wide variety of analytics models and techniques, including the basic ideas behind the models, experience using software to solve/analyze them, and case studies dealing with combining models to find a complete solution. Modeling approaches covered include classification, clustering, change detection, time series modeling, regression models, design of experiments, probability distributions, probability-based models and simulation, PCA, and optimization. Cross-cutting topics like data preparation, model validation, and variable selection are also covered.
